                strictly scientific people who sent you here from Earth?

            unimaginable love and peace to Earth. What happens
            when such love encounters opposition and hatred? Stories
            that are both tragic and joyous are the inevitable results of
            such a collision.

              <p className="bookDescription">Church people joke sometimes about having their own
            language – ‘Christianese.’ People who have no familiarity
            with Christianity have no understanding of words like
            ‘atonement,’ ‘salvation,’ and ‘grace.’ Here are 285
            Christian words explained in a reader-friendly style,
            without any particular denominational slant. These pages
            are particularly helpful to those new to Christianity to help
            them gain understanding of the puzzling world of faith in
            Jesus..</p>

              <p className="bookDescription">World travel was safer in 1971. Thousands of hippies were
            crowding aboard busses and trains in Europe and Asia,
            hungry to experience something new. One 22-year-old,
            the author, remembers his year traveling overland around
            the world, spending extended times in both Japan and
            Pakistan. His very personal accounts of immersion in
            unfamiliar cultures is not a travelogue, but reveals a story
            of discovery that emerges partly as a product of the 70’s,
            and partly as the view of youth.</p>

            little book shows that fascination, self discovery, and relaxation await
            those who will take some time to draw mandalas – an ancient art form used
            in many ways by many cultures. It is an instructional book, inspiring your
            creative discovery, not a coloring book, and by no means an exhaustive examination of the subject. Just for fun.</p>
